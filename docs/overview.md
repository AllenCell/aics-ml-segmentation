# Tutorial:

Assume we have one or a set of 3D microscopy images tagging a specific intracellular structure. the goal of the *Allen Cell Structure Segmenter* is to generate a binary image of the structures segmentation as accurately as possible for each input image. Details, such as the underlying algorithms, validation, data, etc., can be found in our [bioRxiv paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/491035v1). The tutorial will focus on how to run the *Allen Cell Structure Segmenter* (including both classic workflows and iterative DL workflows) to get an acuurate segmentation. The execution is based on three building blocks: **Segmenter**, **Curator** and **Trainer**. We will first explain each building blocks and demonstrate the actual execution in a few applications to generate accurate segmentations.

Understanding each building blocks:
